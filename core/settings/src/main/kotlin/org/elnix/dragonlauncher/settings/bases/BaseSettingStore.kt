/**
 * Base abstract class for a collection of related settings in a [androidx.datastore.core.DataStore].
 *
 * A `BaseSettingsStore` represents a **group of settings** (a settings **Store**) and provides a consistent API to:
 *   - access all settings in the store,
 *   - reset them,
 *   - get/set the entire store as a single object,
 *   - import/export for backup.
 *
 * @param T The aggregate type representing the values of the entire store.
 * @param B The aggregate type representing the backup type,I use 3 main backup types: [JSONObject], [org.json.JSONArray] and `Map<String, Any?`, which is used across the app to store conveniently data
 *
 * ### Responsibilities
 * - Defines a list of all contained settings via [ALL].
 * - Provides utility methods to reset all settings to their defaults.
 * - Requires concrete implementations to provide methods for reading/writing all settings
 *   at once ([getAll], [setAll]).
 * - Supports backup and restore via JSON ([exportForBackup], [importFromBackup]).
 *
